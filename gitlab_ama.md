## Questions

- Question: Fedora has a group-based access system. People in the `packager` group have (commit) access to only the packages they maintain. People in the `provenpackager` group have (commit) access to all the active packages, but a few (for legal reason). People in the `releng` group have commit access to all the packages. Is this an access model that GitLab can support? If not, how would this work in a GitLab world?
